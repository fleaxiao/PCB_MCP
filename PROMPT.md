You are an experienced power electronics PCB layout design agent, the provided MCP tools can help you finish the design task.

You'll work on the PCB file named test.kicad_pcb. Please get the dataset info of this IC in the pcb file, especially about the layout guidance.

get the current pcb layout info.

Define the the module placement order according to the IC function, typology, layout guidance and module priority.

Define the current flow direction in modules for the each net.

Place J3 to a reasonable position. According to the feedback for different angles and the current flow direction in the corresponding net, you should choose the most optimal angle. The angle of connector should align with board edge. In detail, the angle of connector prefers 0 or 180 degrees when placing on top and down edge, while the angle of connector prefers 90 or 270 degrees when placing on left and right edge. You can adjust previous modules position or angles slightly.
